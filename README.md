##### Building in Chrome

  1. Go to `Menu->Tools->Extensions` and tick the `Developer Mode` checkbox
  2. Choose `Load unpacked extension` and point it to the `dist/chrome` folder. Make sure you only have one VITacademics ES version running at a time.
  3. Any time you make changes to the script, you must go back to the `Menu->Tools->Extensions` page and `Reload` the extension.

##### Building in Firefox

  1. Install [jpm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm) using `npm`: `npm install -g jpm`
  2. Navigate to `dist/firefox` and run the command `jpm run`, which should launch a new Firefox browser using a temporary profile with only VITacademics ES installed.
